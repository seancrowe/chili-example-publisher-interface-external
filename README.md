Simple example of publisher interface

Watch this explanation video: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzQlkmdWsCHvkLL_WOvC_P2tUBRWQUct/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzQlkmdWsCHvkLL_WOvC_P2tUBRWQUct/view?usp=sharing)

Open the index.html in your editor of choice and update the `environment`, `apiKey`, `docId` and `workspaceId` variables. Please use an API key with enough permissions.

Obviously this is a simple example, in real like you should never use an API key with too many permissions on the front end.

This example also does not have elegant error handling.

Have fun.
